I made this single page web app, because I wanted to make it simpler to structure and document songs that might have several tempo and/or time signature changes. As such it can be used as a tool for musicians to create a PDF document with the technical details, presented in a simple tabular format, for songs of any format, short or long, simple or complicated.
