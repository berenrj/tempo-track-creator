I made this web app, because I wanted to make a methodical approach of documenting song structures that might have several tempo and/or time signature changes. It can be used as an effective tool for musicians to create an exportable PDF document with all the technical details needed to define a click track in a DAW, presented in a simple tabular format, for the structure of all kinds of music.
